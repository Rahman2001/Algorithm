# Algorithm
At university, we are taught plain old **C programming language** in which we learn algorithms. 
To be honest, I do not like C or C++ programming languages because I have to keep my focus on pointers rather than the logic of algorithms only. 
So I want to learn algorithms in fun and exciting way by implementing them in **Java**. 

## Resources
My favourite book to learn algorithms in Java is 
* ***Algorithms in a Nutshell A Practical Guide*** </br>
