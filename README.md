# Algorithm
At university, we are taught plain old <strong>C programming language</strong> in which we learn algorithms. 
To be honest, I do not like C or C++ programming languages because I have to keep my focus on pointers rather than the logic of algorithms only. 
So I want to learn algorithms in fun and exciting way by implementing them <strong>in Java</strong>.
